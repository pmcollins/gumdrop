# Gumdrop

Gumdrop is an experimental web framework under active development, written in Java, with no dependencies outside of the
JDK.

* [Common](gumdrop.common): common classes (builder, http, validation, etc.)
* [Json](gumdrop.json): a JSON serialization library
* [Web](gumdrop.web): request dispatch and page generation facilities
* [Server](gumdrop.server): a multithreaded, non-blocking IO web server
* [SQL](gumdrop.sql): a thin wrapper around JDBC for ORM-like operations
* [Test](gumdrop.test): unit tests

### Motivations

* Fun
* An opportunity to implement concepts presented in Robert Martin's _Clean Architecture_
* A source for code exercises for a software learning platform I'm working on
